  Each call to stream_detection_alerts streams all detection alerts found after
  req_data["continuationTime"].

  Initial connections should omit continuationTime from the connection request;
  in this case, the server will default the continuation time to the time of
  the connection.

  The server sends a stream of bytes, which is interpreted as a list of python
  dictionaries; each dictionary represents one "detection batch."

      - A detection batch might have the key "error";
        if it does, you should retry connecting with exponential backoff, which
        this function implements.
      - A detection batch might have the key "heartbeat";
        if it does, this is a "heartbeat detection batch", meant as a
        keep-alive message from the server, which your client can ignore.
      - If none of the above apply:
         - The detection batch is a "non-heartbeat detection batch".
           It will have a key, "continuationTime." This
           continuation time should be provided when reconnecting to
           stream_detection_alerts to continue receiving alerts from where the
           last connection left off; the most recent continuation time (which
           will be the maximum continuation time so far) should be provided.
         - The detection batch may optionally have a key, "detections",
           containing detection alerts from Rules Engine. The key will be
           omitted if no new detection alerts were found.

  Example heartbeat detection batch:
    {
      "heartbeat": true,
