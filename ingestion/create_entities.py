r"""Executable and reusable sample for ingesting entities.

WARNING: This script makes use of the Ingestion API V2. V2 is currently only in
preview for certain Chronicle customers. Please reach out to your Chronicle
representative if you wish to use this API.

An entity describes some Noun that is known to the customer. It is used to
package information about Nouns that is discovered separately from event
ingestion. Examples of real-world entities are users, employees, devices, etc.
This sample ingests entities in a structured format, instead of as raw logs.

It accepts a path to a file (--json_entities_file) that contains an array of
JSON formatted Entity data. See ./example_input/sample_entities.json for an
example.

So, assuming you're created a credentials file at ~/.chronicle_credentials.json,
you can run this command using the sample input like so:

$ create_entities --customer_id=<your customer UUID> \
  --log_type=<log type> \
  --json_entities_file=./example_input/sample_entities.json

If you're not sure of what log type you should be using, you can get a set of
valid log types by running list_log_types.py and find an appropriate one.
